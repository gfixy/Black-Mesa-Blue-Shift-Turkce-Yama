//
// This list of soundscripts references sound files (.wavs typically) from either:
//
// bms/sound/***		(BMS Sound Directory)
// hl2/sound/***		(HL2 Sound Directory)
//
//
// As you navigate this list:
// 
//
// There will be soundscript entries native to Half-Life 2, which have not been majorly altered (with the possible exception of channel assignments).
// 
// 
// There will be soundscript entries native to Half-Life 2, but HAVE BEEN UPDATED to override the HL2 sound path with our BMS sound path, so as to
// utilize higher quality recordings (and/or ones with more variety for the random callups)
//
//
// Lastly, there will be entries created specifically for BLACK MESA (therefore, only the bms sound path will be referenced in these cases, unless otherwise specified)
// 
//
//
// Developer Notes has been added to the list to help discern what sound directory is being used on a script by script basis.
